We are building a student class

1. The mandatory parameters are name and age
2. University Name is Optional.

If the user is not providing Uni Name then still he/she should be able to create student object, provided he/she has provided
valid inputs for name and age.
If the user chooses to provide Uni Name then make sure it is valid as well.
